    1. display the event distribution dots on map time window
    2. Precisely display number of event in time slots with Cyan background color
    3. animation time window zooming (after 9/14/13)
    
Version 2.01 prepared on 7/28
  Change the app store image order so the first image will include photo in the map
  
Version 2.0 available on 7/28:
1. Allow an event to have multple photos. In a sense, an event is a photo folder
2. Save/restore photos to dropbox account
3. New version notification when click Settings
4. Rate using iRate https://github.com/nicklockwood/iRate
5. Add more links to Help View
6. Fix iPad add/edit event will shift date unit by one. see TimeScrollWindowNiew line 555
7. changed "Purchase Full Version" to "Support Us" and purchase prompt wording.
8. Show app status such as # of events, # of photos and space taken by photos in "Offline Contents" 
9. in iTunesConnect, replaced "track" with "album" in keywords list

(Possible disaster: myEvent has a lot of event and photo in device, then accidently donwloaded myEvents content from server, thus leave the photos
 in device dangling, only way to remove is remove app)

(Re-submit by add Restore Purchase)
  1. submit process to include In App purchase on iTune

  5. Make zoom time label animation shorter and bounce animated when zooming.
  
     
[6/5/2013] Submit Ver1.1 for all important changes after V1.0
Downloaded from App Store crashed if added at least one note. Crash report does not help.
Then find my case is same as: http://www.mindjuice.net/2011/11/30/how-to-fix-an-app-that-crashes-in-release-but-not-debug/
The crash happens like this: ATViewController call following:
        NSArray * eventList = appDelegate.eventListSorted;
and the array has correct size, but the event inside has null eventDate/eventDesc etc. Have to set Compiler Optimise none as in debug mode

Changed Release Mode Optimization Level to None (same as Debug mode) and submitted as Ver1.1:
   Target -> Build Settings -> Search for Optimiz.., expand it to show debug and release
To run with Release mode: Product -> Scheme Editor -> Run .....

[6/4/2013]
    1. fixed event count in Time Window bucket, need more test, but seems good
    2. change TimeWindow to group upper label by background color, make scroll window see time movement easilytill in review after second submit
[6/2/2013] More important changes, need to submit again:
    1. A big bug fix: remove pin will remove all photos because fileName is nil, so it will remove whole myEvents directory
       (this bug exist always, that is why I lost my pictures before)
    2. A fix: A bug that user can add events even without purchase in purchase alert window
    3. Hide white flag icon behind dark red marker
    4. Add scale-grid background in Time Window
    5. Spell check "Alows" change to "Allows"
    6. Implement customized provider to send HTML to email and text to twitter/facebook
    7. Added labelScale when zoom time and move time

[5/16/2013] V1.0 with new Logo submitted (6/4/2013 approved, but this version will crash)
