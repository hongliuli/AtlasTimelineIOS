[6/5/2013] Submit Ver1.1 for all important changes after V1.0
Downloaded from App Store crashed if added at least one note. Crash report does not help.
Then find my case is same as: http://www.mindjuice.net/2011/11/30/how-to-fix-an-app-that-crashes-in-release-but-not-debug/
The crash happens like this: ATViewController call following:
        NSArray * eventList = appDelegate.eventListSorted;
and the array has correct size, but the event inside has null eventDate/eventDesc etc. Have to set Compiler Optimise none as in debug mode

Changed Release Mode Optimization Level to None (same as Debug mode) and submitted as Ver1.1:
   Target -> Build Settings -> Search for Optimiz.., expand it to show debug and release
To run with Release mode: Product -> Scheme Editor -> Run .....
